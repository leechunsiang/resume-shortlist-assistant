### Tips for Better AI Analysis

1. **Keep formatting simple** - Avoid complex tables or columns
2. **Use clear section headers** - WORK EXPERIENCE, SKILLS, EDUCATION
3. **Include dates** - Helps AI calculate years of experience
4. **List skills clearly** - Comma-separated or bullet points
5. **One resume per file** - Don't combine multiple candidates

### PDF Support

While PDF files are accepted, text extraction may not work properly due to:
- Complex layouts
- Images or scanned documents
- Special formatting
- Encoding issues

**If you must use PDF:**
- Ensure it's a text-based PDF (not a scanned image)
- Avoid complex layouts or tables
- Use standard fonts
- Keep formatting simple

### Troubleshooting

**Problem:** AI extracts empty or incomplete information
- **Solution:** Convert to TXT format and ensure all sections are clearly labeled

**Problem:** Years of experience shows as 0
- **Solution:** Include clear date ranges for work experience (e.g., "2019-2021")

**Problem:** Skills list is empty
- **Solution:** Add a "SKILLS" section with clearly listed skills

**Problem:** Email or name not extracted
- **Solution:** Place contact information at the top of the resume

### Batch Processing

You can upload multiple resumes at once:
1. Convert all PDFs to TXT files
2. Name files clearly: `firstname_lastname_resume.txt`
3. Upload all files together
4. AI will process them one by one
5. Each candidate will be automatically created in the database
